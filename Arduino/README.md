Arduino Lower level Hardware
==============================

The following tasks are done using the Arduino UNO R3 base:

- [x] Calculating Probability distribution of each laser beam when it hits an obstacle

- [ ] Grouping sonar scan in groups of 4 to give a higher proability estimate

- [ ] PID Loop to control motion of motors using encoders

- [ ] Sending I2C data containing array of estimated obstacles and their distances in a full 360 degree scan is send to Raspberry Pi
